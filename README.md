## What is JPhoto

JPhoto, aka BERNACON Photo Organizer, is a graphical Java Swing tool that we use to organize our family photographs.

JPhoto use is quite simple, you just need to select a directory that contains
your family photo collection and a directory where you will put newly added
photos (e.g. photos copied from your phone). The big "Organize" button classifies
the photos to be imported as follows:

1. **NoExif**: photos without exif data.
2. **Duplicates**: photos already present in the family photo library.
3. **Organized**: photos that can be added to the library, grouped in daily folders.

JPhoto is a GUI tool that I created to manage my photo library according to my established *modus operandi*.

JPhoto is a Java-based tool, with a Maven build configuration. I've developed it on a system with Java 15 and Apache Netbeans 13.
